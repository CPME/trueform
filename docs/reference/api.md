# API Reference

The API reference is generated from TSDoc comments in the source.

## Generate

```bash
npm run docs:api
```

This writes static HTML into `docs/public/api` (not committed).

## View

When running the docs site, open:

- `/api/`

[Open the API Reference](/api/)

If you need to regenerate after changes, re-run `npm run docs:api`.
